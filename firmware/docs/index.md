# NodeMCU Documentation

NodeMCU is an [eLua](http://www.eluaproject.net/) based firmware for the [ESP32](http://espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview) and [ESP8266 WiFi SOC from Espressif](http://espressif.com/en/products/esp8266/).  The NodeMCU *firmware* is a companion project to the popular [NodeMCU dev kits](https://github.com/nodemcu/nodemcu-devkit-v1.0), ready-made open source development boards with ESP8266-12E chips.

Support for the new [ESP32 WiFi/BlueTooth SOC from Espressif](http://www.espressif.com/en/products/hardware/esp32/overview) is under way.

## Up-To-Date Documentation
At the moment the only up-to-date documentation maintained by the current NodeMCU team is in [English](en/index.md). It is part of the source code repository (`/docs` subfolder) and kept in sync with the code.

We encourage you to help transferring the outdated translations (see below) into the repository.
